// Project Created in Spring of 2015

In light of recent events of police violence in Baltimore, Ferguson, and Cleveland, many factors seem to influence the outcome 
of civilian interaction with law enforcement. I would like to investigate the relationship between each
of these examples as a potential insight into class dynamics interacting with policing.

*Unfortunately I could only find public data sets regarding county information rather than city so the results will reflect that*

  - prettyprint
  - numpy
